# Walmart_Sales_Forecasting

The Objective is to predict the sales of walmart store.

Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the world and it is very important for them to have accurate forecasts for their sales in various departments.Since there can be many factors that can affect the sales for every department, it becomes imperative that we identify the key factors that play a part in driving the sales and use them to develop a model that can help in forecasting the sales with some accuracy.

For this project, we have used the dataset available from ‘Walmart Store Sales Forecasting’ project that was available on Kaggle. In this dataset, we have weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments for a period of 3 years. In addition, we had store and geography specific information such as store size, unemployment rate, temperature, promotional markdowns etc. Using these factors, we needed to develop a regression model that can forecast the sales and is also computationally efficient and scalable.


The EDA is conducted and the Machine learning algorithms used in this project are Linear Regression, Decision tree and Random forest regressor.
